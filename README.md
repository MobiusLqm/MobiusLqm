## Research Philosophy:
After working on several research projects, I remind myself to always adhere to these guiding principles:

1. Real Innovation:
    - I value research that brings new perspectives, approaches, or solutions to existing problems.
2. Elegance and Simplicity:
    - I aim for solutions that are intuitive, logically sound, and efficientâ€”avoiding unnecessary complexity.
    - "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."  --Albert Einstein
3. Real-World Impact:
    - I believe meaningful research should solve pressing problems and contribute to real-world applications.
4. Clarifying Core Problems:
    -  identifying and understanding the true nature of the problem before initiating solutions, avoiding blind action driven by superficial observations.
