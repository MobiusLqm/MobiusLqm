## Research Philosophy:
I always strive to follow three core principles in my research:

1. Real Innovation:
    - I value research that brings new perspectives, approaches, or solutions to existing problems.
2. Elegance and Simplicity:
    - I aim for solutions that are intuitive, logically sound, and efficientâ€”avoiding unnecessary complexity.
3. Real-World Impact:
    - I believe meaningful research should solve pressing problems and contribute to real-world applications.
